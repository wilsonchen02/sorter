# Sorter
Header file that includes a sorting class that can take in arrays and vectors of any data type or object

Wilson Chen June 2021
Header file containing a bunch of sorting algorithms.
This was intended to be a practice header file, but maybe
I can use it in the future ðŸ˜³

DISCLAIMER: CAN ONLY ACCEPT ARRAYS/VECTORS

This should work for most data types and objects, as long as a comparator is defined.
If not, then it'll use STL's "less" comparator.
